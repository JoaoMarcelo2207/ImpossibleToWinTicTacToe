# ImpossibleToWinTicTacToe
This game is a "horror" game, it's a traditional tic-tac-toe game, but you play against an AI that always wins. This was done by fun and learning machine learning proposals, the algorithm used by the AI is minimax and the AI code was adapted as a way to learn about machine learning from the youtube channel "The Code Train" who made in js.

Known issues: 
 - The AI is not perfect, the AI makes it her purpose to always win or draw but sometimes she doesn't do it in the best way possible
 - Peformace Issue ( it's for learning propositals so feel free to modify or make a better code).

[SPOILER WARING]: For the horror elements, I created a function that creates 2 txt files on the player's desktop, joking about the unbeatable AI taking over your pc and showing a fake ip, nothing malicious just a silly prank of a "horror" game to send to friends
